# Pebble

This repository contains some code snippets for pebble apps/watchaces I've written. Each directory only contains the "src" directory of a pebble project, with some additional binaries such as the compiled app and/or screenshots.

## Dryuntil
Dryuntil is a watchapp that shows how long until the next rain shower for the current location. It retrieves weather data from buienradar.nl, so it may only work in .nl.

## Fullcircle
A watchface that shows time as a progressing circle with the hour in text in the center. Upon shake/tap, the date is shown in the center. See the screenshots in the src directory.
