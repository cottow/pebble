# Pebble

This repository contains some code snippets for pebble apps/watchaces I've written. Each directory only contains the "src" directory of a pebble project, with some additional binaries such as the compiled app and/or screenshots.

To build and run these projects, create a new project with the pebble tool and copy the source files to the src directory. Then build and install using the pebble tool.

If you just want to install the apps, download the .pbw file. If you download it on a phone where the pebble app is installed, it will allow you to install it on your Pebble directly. If you download it to a computer, install it on your Pebble using "pebble install".

## Dryuntil
Dryuntil is a watchapp that shows how long until the next rain shower for the current location. It retrieves weather data from buienradar.nl, so it may only work in .nl.

## Fullcircle
A watchface that shows time as a progressing circle with the hour in text in the center. Upon shake/tap, the date is shown in the center. See the screenshots in the src directory.
